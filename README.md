<h3> <B>Problem Statement: City wide dark store network projection</B></h3>
<ul>Problems we Solved : </ul>
<li>Proper Geographical analysis </li>
<li>well sufficient for highly population Density </li>
<li>Sufficient to Tackle Traffic issue </li>
<li>Cost management</li>
<li>Social events handling for timeless service</li>
<li>Demand Forcasting</li>

<h2>What we did ?</h2>
<p>Collected Data and Research paper from various source and carry out a detail Data-Analysis which help us to go indepp of problem statement</p>

<p>Our next step is to find the Problems which is affecting to find a proper hotpots(Warehouse) </p>

<p>After cleaning the data we made a <b>csv file of pune data Population</b>. After that we had made various graph through for proper understanding</p>

<p>Firstly we created a map <i>Pune_Population</i>which is on <b>Graph_created_through_data</b> and divide the pune in 3 parts (red,blue,green) Red: high Density, Blue: medium or average Density, Green: Low Density, and given the ranking according to it </p>

<p>Traffic is one of the major problems for smooth delivery: that why we created a graph of <B>Traffic jams</B> we made this graph by dividing day in parts and we find the time of the particular location when a Traffic is on peak. This helps us to Be-Ready to face Traffic Issue</p>

<h2>Coding</h2>
<p>In coding we created a website which has our proper Data-Anaytics and features we made</p>
<p>For Demand forcasting and to find the best spots of our warehouse we created ML model through algorithm K-Means Clustering and various optimal parameters </p>
<h2>Code is available on <b>Code</b>folder</h2>
<h3> after using our ml model on Pune we find the best Hotspots for our warehouse</h3>

importancae of this graph like traffic clustering
