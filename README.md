<ul>Problems we Solved : </ul>
<li>Proper Geographical analysis </li>
<li>well sufficient for highly population Density </li>
<li>Sufficient to Tackle Traffic issue </li>
<li>Cost management</li>
<li>Social events handling for timeless service</li>
<li>Demand Forcasting</li>

<h2>What we did ?</h2>
<p>Collected Data and Research paper from various source and carry out a detail Data-Analysis which help us to go indepp of problem statement</p>

<p>Our next step is to find the Problems which is affecting to find a proper hotpots(Warehouse) </p>

<p>After cleaning the data we made a <b>csv file of pune data Population</b>. After that we had made various graph through for proper understanding</p>

<p>Firstly we created a map <i>Pune_Population</i>which is on <b>Graph_created_through_data</b> and divide the pune in 3 parts (red,blue,green) Red: high Density, Blue: medium or average Density, Green: Low Density, and given the ranking according to it </p>

<p>Traffic is one of the major problems for smooth delivery: that why we created a graph of <B>Traffic jams</B> we made this graph by dividing day in parts and we find the time of the particular location when a Traffic is on peak. This helps us to Be-Ready to face Traffic Issue</p>

<h2>Coding</h2>
<p>In coding we created a website which has our proper Data-Anaytics and features we made</p>
<p>For Demand forcasting and to find the best spots of our warehouse we created ML model through algorithm K-Means Clustering and various optimal parameters </p>
<h3>Code is available on <b>Code</b> folder</h3>
<h3> after using our ml model on Pune we find the best Hotspots for our warehouse</h3>

![Hotspots](https://github.com/Bit-Bard/Cyber-Flame-/blob/main/Hackron/Graph_created_through_data/ML_model_prediction.jpg)

<ul>Why these warehouse location are recommended ?</ul>
<li>Cost Effecient
<li>Fast Delivery(Traffic Tackling)
<li>Social Event Friendly
<li>Maximum effeciency and customer reach

<p>As per the number of Population Density increases numbers of warehouse also increase due to their demands which help us to manage <b>Traffic, Availability, Time-Reduction</p>
<P>If a rehgion comes under Green zone(low-density) the number of clusters increases so that the diameter of a Particular warehouse increases which help us in<b>Cost Reduction</b>Reason: we will not include that much of warehouse which is not needed in a low-density region</P>
